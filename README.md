# This is a work-in-progress repository for figures contained in "Modern applications of machine learning in quantum sciences"
## Eventually, I will make a public repo containing all data and files from here but without the history ;)

Moreover, folder `colors` contains:
- `colors_dict.pkl` - pickled dictionary with our RGB-coded five main colors (green, purple, yellow, orange, blue) and their three shades (dark, medium, light),
- `colors_1D.pkl` - the same colors in 1D array,
- `colors_2D.pkl` - colors in 2D array,
- Jupyter notebook that shows how to unpickle them.

Finally, folder `fonts` contains:
- set of fonts called *New Hero* used for text in plots,
- Jupyter notebook that shows how to use them with Python.
