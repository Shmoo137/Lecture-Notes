List of our figures:
- 1.3 % of ML-based articles in the selected fields in years 2000-2021
- 2.1 Plots of the (a) binary cross-entropy and (b) mean-squared error (ANNA)
- 3.1 Ising model (ROUVEN and JULIAN)
- 3.2 IGT (ROUVEN and JULIAN)
- 3.3bc PCA (ROUVEN and JULIAN)
- 3.6 Learning by confusion (ROUVEN and JULIAN)
- 3.7 Pediction-based method (ROUVEN and JULIAN)
- 4.1 Toy example of a labeled two-dimensional data set
- 4.3 The kernel form makes a difference
- 4.6 Selection of new candidate points via BO using Upper Confidence Bound acquisition function
- 6.4a Parameter update for a random walker (BORJA)
- 7.4 Inverse Schr√∂dinger problem solved using dP
- 8.4 Perceptron capacity by Cover
- 8.11 Illustration of a quantum circuit (PAOLO)

Moreover, folder `colors` contains:
- `colors_dict.pkl` - pickled dictionary with our RGB-coded five main colors (green, purple, yellow, orange, blue) and their three shades (dark, medium, light),
- `colors_1D.pkl` - the same colors in 1D array,
- `colors_2D.pkl` - colors in 2D array,
- Jupyter notebook that shows how to unpickle them.

Finally, folder `fonts` contains:
- set of fonts called *New Hero* used for text in plots,
- Jupyter notebook that shows how to use them with Python.
